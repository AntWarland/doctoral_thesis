Prerequisites:
Install ScaleHd on local server following https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html
Extract index.zip and copy files to your scratch drive. Note the directory.

ScaleHD takes .Fastq/.Fq format. It expects read 1 (R1) and read 2 (R2) format, 
and will fail unless an balanced number of files that end in those formats. 
If you donâ€™t have R2 reads you could probably just cut and paste R1 again. 
So for a 384 plate the program will expect 768 files in a directory, 
half ending in R1 and half in R2. 
Adjust based on the number of samples you want to have per run.

Running PacBio reads on ScaleHD
1. Trim Pacbio fastq reads with 'Trim_Pacbio_reads_fwfw.sh'
2. Modify derectories to your own in the ScaleHD config file 'scaleHD_config_29JAN2020.xml'
3. Modify 'Submission_script_PacBio_ScaleHD_v1.sh' to point to the config file and output directories
4. Run ScaleHD with the script using the command:
sbatch /[your script directory]/[your script]
